# ITCS 5122 - BERT Sentimental LIAR

Final Project/ Paper for Visual Analytics - ITCS 5122 
University of North Carolina at Charlotte

The following work flow follows an implementation of a model found in [Sentimental LIAR](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.01047) presented by Bibek Upadhayay and Vahid Behzadan

This follows the implementation by the authoes found [here](https://github.com/UNHSAILLab/SentimentalLIAR),  
with minor changes to run locally without errors, and extra explantions in the code.


## Documentation

View the iPython notebook [here](BERT-CNN-Sentimental-Liar.ipynb)

The model included is an implementation of BERT-CNN, setup for 2-way classification on the Sentimental LIAR dataset.

Currently, it will run 2 training epochs, but there is further room for improvement here and in the hyperparameters.
